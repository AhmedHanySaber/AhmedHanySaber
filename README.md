A brief description of what this project does and who it's for


## ðŸš€ About Me
Hi there! My name is Ahmed Hany, and I'm a software engineer and instructor with a passion for teaching and mobile development.

I've been working in the tech industry for 2 number of years, and during that time, I've had the opportunity to work on a variety of exciting projects. From developing mobile apps for iOS and Android to teaching others how to code, I've developed a deep understanding of what it takes to create high-quality software that meets the needs of users.

As an instructor, I believe in empowering others to learn and grow. Whether I'm teaching a class, creating online tutorials, or mentoring junior developers, I strive to create an environment that fosters curiosity and encourages experimentation. I believe that anyone can learn to code, and I'm committed to helping others unlock their full potential.

In my free time, I enjoy tinkering with new technologies, exploring the outdoors, and spending time with my family. I'm also an avid reader and love discovering new books on a wide range of topics.

If you're interested in mobile development, software engineering, or just want to connect with a fellow tech enthusiast, feel free to reach out! I'm always looking for new opportunities to collaborate and learn from others.
