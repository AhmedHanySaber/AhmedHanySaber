# ðŸš€ About Me
Hi there! My name is Ahmed Hany, and I'm a software engineer and instructor with a passion for teaching and mobile development.

I've been working in the tech industry for 2 years, and during that time, I've had the opportunity to work on a variety of exciting projects. From developing mobile apps for iOS and Android to teaching others how to code, I've developed a deep understanding of what it takes to create high-quality software that meets users' needs.

As an instructor, I believe in empowering others to learn and grow. Whether I'm teaching a class, creating online tutorials, or mentoring junior developers, I strive to create an environment that fosters curiosity and encourages experimentation.

In my free time, I enjoy tinkering with new technologies, exploring the outdoors, and spending time with my family. I'm also an avid reader and love discovering new books on a wide range of topics.

If you're interested in mobile development, or software engineering, or just want to connect with a fellow tech enthusiast, feel free to reach out! I'm always looking for new opportunities to collaborate and learn from others.
